I'm a recent graduate from [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu), where I studied [Computer Science](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/majors/cs), [Interactive Media Arts](http://ima.nyu.sh) and [Studio Art](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/art/studio/minor/studio_art_minor).

I love so many things that I don't want to give myself a title.
