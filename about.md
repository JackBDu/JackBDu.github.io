I am a non-robotic being grew up in [Yanâ€™an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan%27an), a small city in [northern Shaanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Shaanxi). I love drawing and doing all sorts of stuff on a computer since I was a kid, so I studied computer science in college, and also learned some art skills.

At the moment, I work as an arts instructor of [Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). And I always seek the opporunity to create art with all sorts of technologies.

I built [Minus E](http://minusetheartbot.me), a robotic system that I collaborate with to create large-scale drawings. Our work won the 5th place in the [2017 Robot Art Competition](https://robotart.org/2017-winners/).
