I currently work as an Assistant Instructor of Interactive Media at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu). I graduated from [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu) with a Bachelor of Science degree in [Computer Science](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/majors/cs) and [Interactive Media Arts](https://ima.nyu.sh). I rediscovered my passion for drawing while studying in New York, and later, I studied [Visual Arts](https://nyuadvis.art) in Abu Dhabi.

I built [Minus E](http://minusetheartbot.me), a robot that creates large-scale drawings, whose work won the 5th place in the [2017 Robot Art Competition](https://robotart.org/2017-winners/). The development of Minus E made me realize my deep interest in the creation of traditional visual art with aid of modern technology like computer vision and robotics, which often explores the human visual perception of pixelated visual art.
