## Step 1: Create New Project

We start off by launching the application either in Launchpad or with Spotlight.

![Spotlight]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/{{ page.categories[0] }}/getting-started-with-premiere/spotlight.png)

Once Premiere is launched, the first thing we see is the Start window, where we can create a new project by clicking New Project... and we will see the window below. Name and Location are the two fields we need to change based on our needs, and we can leave everything else default for the purpose of this tutorial.

Once our project is created, we may see a different workspace depending on the previous user settings. There are two steps (as illustrated below) we need to do in order to make sure we are on the same workspace. And this is also what we do whenever we get lost (when don't know where everything is).

![Menu Bar]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/{{ page.categories[0] }}/getting-started-with-premiere/menu-bar-window.png)

1. Choose Window > Workspaces > All Panels. This sets the workspace to All Panels.
2. Choose Window > Workspaces > Reset to Saved Layout. This resets All Panels to default.

Here's what the workspace should look like after the reset.

## Step 2: Create New Sequence

Now that we have created our project and we are on the same workspace, let's [create a new squence](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/creating-changing-sequences.html).

![New Sequence]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/{{ page.categories[0] }}/getting-started-with-premiere/new-sequence.png)

As we can see in the above image, we need to choose a Seqence Preset, which should be based on the footage we will be using. Here, I will be using Digital SLR > 1080p > DSLR 1080p30. We can also name the sequence at the bottom of the window, and then we click OK to create the sequence.

![Workspace with Sequence]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/{{ page.categories[0] }}/getting-started-with-premiere/workspace-with-sequence.png)

We can manage our sequences in the bottom-left panel, and we can see that the sequence is automatically opened in the bottom-middle panel and a preview of the sequence can be seen on the top-middle panel.

## Step 3: Import Media

Now let's import some media, a.k.a., footage, audios, etc.

1. Go to File > Import...
2. Choose the files we want to import and click import.

Similar to sequences, the imported media can also be managed in the bottom-left panel, and if we double click one of them, we will be seeing a preview in the top-left panel. Alternatively, we can also import media through Media Browser, which is also located at the bottom-left corner.

## Step 4: Learn the Tools
